# Function Optimization Lab (CSO Project 3, Spring 2016)

This project was completed for Computer Systems Organization at NYU, taught by Joanna Klukowska. The project specs can be found here:`http://cs.nyu.edu/~joannakl/cs201.02_s16/assignments/proj3.pdf`

In this lab we were given multiple functions (or, "levels") written in C to optimize with cache-aware programming techniques, while maintaining the functionality of the original function. This lab tested our understanding of temporal and spatial locality at its most practical level.
